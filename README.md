This project contains the Driver Drowsiness Detection system which helps to alert the drivers when they are on the wheel and dose off.

According to the researchers in USA, an estimate of 20% accidents occur due to the drowsiness of the driver.Although there is no available data in India on this matter but Indian roads could have worse statistics as it has much higher percentage of the road accidents.
Hence,this type of system has a very crucial application in the modern world especially when the drivers are getting tired due to extended working hours.

The system computes the Eye-Aspect Ratio(EAR) and sound the alarm in case of EAR falls below the designated threshold. This threshold has been computed using experimental methods.
The system makes use of OpenCV and dlib library. The dlib library has face detection algorithms which accurately detects the facial landmarks(in our case Eyes)
